      `<h2>RELEASE AND WAIVER OF LIABILITY, ASSUMPTION OF RISK, AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT (“AGREEMENT”)</h2>
        <p>IN CONSIDERATION of being permitted to participate in Denver PrideFest (“Activity”) as a volunteer I, for
          myself, my personal representatives, assigns, heirs, and next of kin:</p>
        <p>ACKNOWLEDGE, agree, and represent that I understand the nature of PrideFest volunteer activity and that I am
          qualified, in good health, and in proper physical condition to participate in such Activity. I further
          acknowledge that the Activity will be conducted over public roads, sidewalks, and facilities open to the
          public during the Activity and upon which the hazards of traveling are to be expected. I further agree and
          warrant that if, at any time, I believe conditions to be unsafe, I will immediately discontinue further
          participation in the Activity.</p>
        <p>FULLY UNDERSTAND that: (a) PRIDEFEST VOLUNTEER ACTIVITIES MAY INVOLVE RISKS AND DANGERS OF SERIOUS BODILY
          INJURY, INCLUDING PERMANENT DISABILITY, PARALYSIS AND DEATH (“RISKS”); (b) these Risks and dangers may be
          caused by my own actions, or inactions, the actions or inactions of others participating in the Activity, or
          the condition in which the Activity takes place; (c) I AM EXPECTED TO COMPLY WITH ALL STATE, LOCAL, AND
          MUNICIPAL LAWS in the course of my conduct in the Activity, including commands of law enforcement personnel,
          and will be SOLELY RESPONSIBLE FOR ANY LEGAL ACTION (INCLUDING ARREST) brought against me for my
          non-compliance with Colorado law and/or non-compliance with law enforcement commands; (d) there may be OTHER
          RISKS AND SOCIAL AND ECONOMIC LOSSES either not known to me or not readily foreseeable at this time; and I
          FULLY ACCEPT AND ASSUME ALL SUCH RISKS AND ALL RESPONSIBILITY FOR LOSSES, COSTS, AND DAMAGES I incur as a
          result of my participation in the Activity.</p>
        <p>HEREBY RELEASE, DISCHARGE, AND COVENANT NOT TO SUE THE GLBT COMMUNITY CENTER OF COLORADO AND DENVER
          PRIDEFEST, their administrators, directors, agents, officers, members, volunteers, and employees, other
          participants, any sponsors, and advertisers (each considered one of the “RELEASEES” herein) FROM ALL
          LIABILITY, CLAIMS, DEMANDS, LOSSES, OR DAMAGES ON MY ACCOUNT CAUSED OR ALLEGED TO BE CAUSED IN WHOLE OR IN
          PART BY THE NEGLIGENCE OF THE “RELEASEES” OR OTHERWISE; AND I FURTHER AGREE that if, despite this RELEASE AND
          WAIVER OF LIABILITY, ASSUMPTION OF RISK, AND INDEMNITY AGREEMENT I, or anyone on my behalf, makes a claim
          against any of the Releasees, I WILL INDEMNIFY, SAVE, AND HOLD HARMLESS EACH OF THE RELEASEES from any
          litigation expenses, attorney fees, loss, liability, damage, or cost which any may incur as the result of such
          claim.</p>
        <p>I HAVE READ THIS AGREEMENT, FULLY UNDERSTAND ITS TERMS, UNDERSTAND THAT I HAVE GIVEN UP SUBSTANTIAL RIGHTS BY
          SIGNING IT, AND HAVE SIGNED IT FREELY AND WITHOUT ANY INDUCEMENT OR ASSURANCE OF ANY NATURE AND INTEND IT TO
          BE A COMPLETE AND UNCONDITIONAL RELEASE OF ALL LIABILITY TO THE GREATEST EXTENT ALLOWED BY LAW AND AGREE THAT
          IF ANY PORTION OF THIS AGREEMENT IS HELD TO BE INVALID THE BALANCE, NOTWITHSTANDING, SHALL CONTINUE IN FULL
          FORCE AND EFFECT.</p>
        <h3>Non-Discrimination Disclosure</h3>

          the festival agree at all times to honor and abide by the following statement of non-discrimination in word
          and action. Anyone associated with the festival, or their employees or associates on festival grounds in
          violation of this agreement will be asked to leave festival grounds immediately and will forfeit all rental
          fees, sponsorship fees, and damage deposits as applicable. Additionally, any actions taken or statements made
          to individuals or groups contrary to this policy or the spirit and intention of this policy are not permitted
          on festival grounds, or in any communication associated with the festival:</p>
        <p>“All persons associated with PrideFest will provide service to individuals without regard to an individual’s

        <h3>Drug and Alcohol Guidelines</h3>
        <p>The Center and Denver PrideFest has a vital interest in maintaining safe, healthful and efficient working
          conditions for all employees and volunteers. The use of drugs, including alcohol, while working or volunteers
          at Denver PrideFest can pose serious health and safety threats to the employees, volunteers, community members
          and the public. The Drug & Alcohol policy is designed for maintaining a drug and alcohol-free workplace and
          Denver PrideFest, and applies agency-wide.</p>
        <p>The Center prohibits the unlawful sale, distribution, dispensing, possession, or use of any nonprescription
          drugs or alcohol at Denver PrideFest. Employees and volunteers are prohibited from reporting to work under the
          influence or apparent influence of drugs or alcohol.</p>
        <p>Any volunteer violating our drug and alcohol guidelines will be asked to return their volunteer t-shirt, will
          not be eligible for any future volunteer opportunities with The Center or Denver PrideFest, and will be
          escorted off of the festival grounds and not able to return.</p>
        <h3>Safe Space Statement</h3>
        <p>The Center staff, Board of Directors and volunteers regard The Center and Denver PrideFest as a safe space.
          Through our services we work to promote the tolerance, acceptance and appreciation of oneself and of others.
          In our efforts to promote diversity and fight ignorance, we have worked to make The Center and Denver
          PrideFest a safe place for all people. As an employee or volunteer, you are expected to respect staff,
          clients, community members, festival attendees and volunteers. This means that clients, staff, directors and
          volunteers should be treated with respect and should be afforded the privacy they desire.</p>
        <p>As part of our commitment to making The Center and Denver PrideFest a safe space for all people, we oppose
          intimidation, harassment and bigotry. Harassment, be it sexual, verbal or physical, and bigotry are not
          acceptable. Being a safe environment, we ask people to refrain from actions and language that may offend
          others. Actively respecting each person’s preferred pronoun is mandatory. While diversity includes diverse
          opinions, it is important to have respect and to show courtesy toward others.</p>
        <p><b>I have read, understand, and agree to the volunteer policies of The Center displayed above.</b></p>`,
