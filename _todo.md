* Determine how to pull in T&Cs
* Have logo loaded from an external resource (maybe falling back to the default)
* standardize application of id and name for dom elements
* standardize on 'undefined' for empty strings
* does moving fields into a form ease access on mobile devices
* see if the checkbox highlighting can be improved
* i'd love to find a good way to do input masking
